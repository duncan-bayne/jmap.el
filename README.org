** status
jmap.el is in very early development.  There's nothing much to see
here for now.

** license
jmap.el is licensed under the GNU Lesser General Public License.

*** why the LGPL?
The GPL is specifically designed to reduce the usefulness of
GPL-licensed code to closed-source, proprietary software. The BSD
license (and similar) don't mandate code-sharing if the BSD-licensed
code is modified by licensees. The LGPL achieves the best of both
worlds: an LGPL-licensed library can be incorporated within
closed-source proprietary code, and yet those using an LGPL-licensed
library are required to release source code to that library if they
change it.
